Hello! 

In this folder you will find my model of the 2024 Presidential election. A few notes:

1) This is a work-in-progress, and a VERY rough model
2) Currently, the model works as follows:
  - Inputs: 
    -National polling average
    -Standard deviation of national average
    -Expected mean swing by state (ex. a lean here represents an expected underpolling of a candidate)
    -Standard deviation of the state-level swings
    -PVI for each constituency (state, federal district, and congressional districts awarding electors) 
  - Results:
    -A winner for each state, the District of Columbia, and each of Maine and Nebraska's congressional districts
    -A calculation of electors won by either party's candidate 
    -An expected win percentage based on inputs
  - Caveats:
    -This model assumes no 3rd party candidates (not true) and that no 3rd party candidates could potentially win a state (uncertain but likely true)
    -This model assumes the PVI lean being imported (currently from 2022) is acccurate- it has likely shifted somewhat
    -This model assumes state-level swings are independent- this is definitely incorrect, but simpler to simulate
    -Finally, this assumes no state-level refusal to certify electors, faithless electors, electors writing 'John Ewards', etc cetera
3) Future additions:
  - Correlate state-level results
  - Automatically ingest polling averages (is there an API still offering this?)
  - Create a shiny app UI 
  - Summarization of results- ex. which combos are most common for winners etc 

Please feel free to reach out with any questions or recommendations. 

Thanks!,
B
